## What is this?

The Monsters Rolodex app is the app used to explain the basic concepts of React as part of the Andrei Neagoie and Yihua Zhang Udemy course, [Complete React Developer in 2020 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/).

## Topics covered

The basics of React are covered in this part of the course. Whilst building this app you cover the following:

* Setting up a Development environment
* Creating a React app using the boilerplate [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
* ES6
* React State and Props
* A deployment to GitHub pages

## Teaching

At the beginning of the course and for most of the theory, Andrei Neagoie is the tutor. He has a good way of explaining things. He makes you think about what it takes to be a good Developer. He encourages you to think about how to structure the components and think about how to manage the state and at what level in the app. I will probably re-watch these part of the course as it is always good to take a step back at the beginning and think about these things.

## My thoughts

This is a new course and I started it after completing the [Expensify App](/portfolio/complete-react-developer-expensify/). I spent a lot of time looking at [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) during that course so having [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html), that does all of the work for you, is amazing. That is mostly what I took out of this app development. Maybe I need to go back to the other apps and update them? However, it does mean that my understanding is a little more broad which could be a good thing. It feels more like I have been on a journey of discovery through the training courses.

The app itself is just an API call, a display of the retrieved data and a search filter. It's very simple, so much so that it can be hosted on Github.
