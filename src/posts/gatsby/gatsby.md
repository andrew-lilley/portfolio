This is my first Gatsby website. When I decided to try out Gatsby, I did a search for tutorials on YouTube. That seemed like a good place to start. I stumbled across
[Gatsby JS - The Great Gatsby Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM).

The Great Gatsby Bootcamp offers a reasonable introduction to Gatsby. The aim of the mini course by [Andrew Mead](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCScXYvmDD7hyFVX6X5ZwE_Q) is for you to have a fully functional Gatsby blog deployed live to the web with content coming via the online CMS [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/).

At the moment, this website is actually just running using [markdown pages](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-markdown-pages/). This gives you a nice little introduction to [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). Moving over to Contentful looks relatively straight forward. Once I have looked at the product and the pricing plans, perhaps I'll move over to it.

Aside from the course, I have made some minor styling adjustments and I have added some items to improve the SEO score in [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse). This included adding the [progressive web app plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-offline/) for Gatsby.

Overall, the Gatsby library has so many plugins and the documentation is good and clear. There's a lot more to explore but for my purposes right now, I'm going to move on.
