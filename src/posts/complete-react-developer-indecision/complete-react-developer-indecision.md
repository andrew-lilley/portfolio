## What is this?

The Indecision app is the first app in the Andrew Mead's Udemy course, [The Complete React Developer Course (w/ Hooks and Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-2nd-edition/).

## Topics covered

The course covered the following:

* Class components and stateless functional components
* Nesting components
* ES6
* React State and Props
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
* Using third party React components
* SCSS

## Teaching

The teaching style of the course is to explain to you what you need to do via the introduction of a topic. Andrew then demonstrates it by starting to write the code. However, he then sets a task. If you complete that task yourself, it aims to demonstrate that you have understood the topic. For example, he would create a component and then set the task of creating another similar component. In this sense you felt like you were building some of the app independently.

For elements like ES6 he sets out to demonstrate independently of the app a feature before returning to the app so you could see the code in isolation before being exposed to its relevance to the app. These included promises, spreading and deconstructing which are vital for understanding the code.

## My thoughts

This was a pretty straight forward app. It could be written in traditional javascript or jquery. However, it was a nice introduction to React and some of the concepts. It introduced me to the concept of props and state and set up things nicely for me to understand why Redux is used for larger apps.

*As this is hosted on a free plan at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), the app goes into hibernation when it is not in use. As such it might take some time to initially load.*
