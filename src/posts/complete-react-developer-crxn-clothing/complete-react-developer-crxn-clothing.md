## What is this?

The CRXN Clothing app is the principle app of the Andrei Neagoie and Yihua Zhang Udemy course, [Complete React Developer in 2020 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/).

In the preview video there is a really big sell on this training course. By the end, you will have a fully functional complete ecommerce website that would have otherwise had taken many months to build. I am still working on this course so let's see how close we get to that in the end.

## Topics covered

There are many topics covered in this course. The course is mainly led by Yihua Zhang and he has a slightly different approach to the file directory structure and file naming conventions than what I was previously seeing on the last course but that was fine. 

The course covered the following:

* React Router and Routing
* Component building such as how to break up a design into components
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) with Firestore data storage and user authentication
* Redux including [reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect)
* A deployment to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
* A payment integration with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
* CSS in JS using [styled components](https://styled-components.com/)
* More advanced React concepts such as Memoization

## Teaching

The teaching style for this course led by Yihua Zhang was akin to pair programming. There were no delegated tasks to do. You watched and coded along. As this was not my first React course, this was absolutely fine for me.

## My thoughts

As this was more like pair programming, I felt more like I was at work than doing a training course. As such, I started to notice things such as the Stripe integration being out of date, a lot of ecommerce functionality is actually missing (clothes and trainers without size and colour options). The UX probably requires some improvements too.

I think that you have to accept the website for what it is, it is a demonstration website to illustrate that you have understood and employed the basic, and some advanced, concepts of React to create a functional website.

The website actually feels fast and at a quick glance it looks quite impressive.

## Extras

For this course more than the others so far, I felt like making additions. Perhaps it is because the end product is more aligned to what I do from day to day in my job? So far I have added an order complete page and a currency selector. This helped me to feel like it was more of a project than a training course. I did consider upgrading the Stripe integration but it does not really fit with what I am doing. I have done payment integrations before and I have a growing list of training course that I want to do.
